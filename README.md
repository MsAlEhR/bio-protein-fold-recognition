Fold Protein Recognition

# Abstract
Protein fold recognition plays a crucial role in discovering three-dimensional structure of proteins and protein functions. Several approaches have been employed for the prediction of protein folds. Some of these approaches are based on extracting features from protein sequences and using a strong classifier. Feature extraction techniques generally utilize syntactical-based information, evolutionary-based information and physicochemical-based information to extract features. In recent years, finding an efficient technique for integrating discriminate features have been received advancing attention. In this study, we integrate Auto-Cross-Covariance and Separated dimer evolutionary feature extraction methods. The resultsâ€™ features are scored by Information gain to define and select several discriminated features. According to three benchmark datasets, DD, RDD ,and EDD, the results of the support vector machine show more than 6% improvement in accuracy on these benchmark datasets.[1]
